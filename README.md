# MindSpace-AI
## About the Project
MindSpace AI is a mobile platform built for the way Gen Z actually lives. We aren't just another clinical tool; we are an AI-driven "trusted space" offering 24/7 emotional support through techniques like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).  
Our mission is rooted in the UN Sustainable Development Goals:
• SDG 3: Prioritizing mental health and well-being.  
• SDG 10: Closing the gap for those who lack access to traditional care.  
• SDG 17: Building scalable partnerships for global change.  
Starting in Kuwait, we are bridging the gap between outdated therapy and the digital reality of today’s youth.

## Inspiration
The idea for MindSpace AI came from seeing the silent crisis our generation faces—anxiety, burnout, and loneliness fueled by social media and economic pressure.  
In regions like Kuwait, seeking help is often blocked by social stigma, high costs, and a lack of services that "get" us. Many of our peers suffer in silence to avoid judgment from family or community. We wanted to build something that feels natural—a safe, anonymous space for those "real-life" moments of overwhelm, accessible without fear or high fees.
