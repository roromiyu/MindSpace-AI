# MindSpace-AI
## About the Project
MindSpace AI is an AI-powered, mobile-first mental health platform specifically designed to address the growing emotional distress among Generation Z. Developed in alignment with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)—specifically SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), and SDG 17 (Partnerships)—the platform provides 24/7 emotional support using evidence-based techniques like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).  
Starting in Kuwait and scaling globally, MindSpace AI bridges the gap between traditional therapy and the digital habits of young adults.  
## Inspiration
Gen Z faces a disproportionate amount of anxiety, burnout, and loneliness, driven by social media pressure and economic uncertainty. In many regions, including Kuwait, seeking help is often hindered by social stigma, high costs, and a lack of youth-focused services.  
We were inspired to create a "trusted space" rather than a clinical system—a platform where users can find instant, anonymous, and culturally sensitive support during their most vulnerable moments, such as late-night anxiety or academic overwhelm.
